Web API can be consumed by any clients which support HTTP verbs such as GET, PUT,
DELETE, POST. Since Web API services do not require configuration, they can be easily used
by any client. In fact, even portable devices such as mobile devices can easily use Web API,
which is undoubtedly the biggest advantage of this technology.

save Simple Student Data. Retrieve and Delete Student Data.
